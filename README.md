# ForumWithBlazor
This is my first Blazor Project, a simple forum called Punkit, so basically a reddit clone. For now its features include signing up, logging in, creating, editing and removing posts, and also commenting on them.
Features that I plan on adding are:  a point system based on upvotes/downvotes, subcomments, subforums, editing account including profile  picture, adding media to the posts, options to customise sub-forums and much more.
The overall structure of the application consists of a blazor server app, an application logic layer and a data access layer. 


Below is how the index page of the app looks and that reflects in the overall color pallete and aesthetic of the app.
