# ForumWithBlazor
This is my first Blazor Project, a simple forum called Punkit, so basically a reddit clone. For now its features include singing up, logging in, creating, editing and removing posts, and also commenting on them.
Features that I plan on adding are:  a point system based on upvotes/downvotes, subcomments, subforums, editing account including profile  picture, adding media to the posts, options to customise sub-forums and much more.
The overall structure of the application consists of a blazor server app, an application logic layer and a data access layer. 
For now this is not connected through web services, but it will be in the very near future. 
The data is stored in files as of now, but it will be upgraded to a EFC that communicates with a database soon as well.
